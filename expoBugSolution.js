The solution to this type of error often involves a methodical investigation of several potential causes:

1. **Check File Permissions:** Ensure that the project directory and its contents have the correct permissions for the build process.  Incorrect permissions can lead to unexpected behavior.

2. **Verify File Paths:** Carefully review all file paths within the project configuration (e.g., `app.json`, `package.json`, native module configurations) to ensure accuracy and consistency. Typos or incorrect references can disrupt the build.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning the project's cache and performing a fresh rebuild. Expo provides commands to facilitate this process:
   ```bash
   expo prebuild --clean
   expo build:android --clean
   expo build:ios --clean
   ```

4. **Examine Native Modules:** If the project uses native modules, carefully check their configurations and ensure they are correctly integrated and compatible with the Expo SDK version.

5. **Check for Conflicting Dependencies:** Review the project's `package.json` file for any conflicting or incompatible dependencies that could interfere with the build process.

6. **Update Expo CLI and Dependencies:** Make sure your Expo CLI and related dependencies are up-to-date by running:
   ```bash
   npm update -g expo-cli
   npm install
   ```

7. **Investigate Environment Variables:** Check for any environment variables that could be interfering.  Temporarily disable or modify them to isolate their effect. 

8. **Review Logs Carefully:** Thoroughly inspect the build logs and error messages for hints or clues, as seemingly minor details can often reveal the cause.

9. **Restart the System:** In some cases, a simple system restart can resolve temporary file system or process issues. 

10. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** If the issue persists, create a minimal project that reproduces the error to aid in debugging.  This helps eliminate irrelevant factors and isolate the problem.
