This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project.  It typically manifests as a cryptic error message during the build process, often related to unexpected file system behavior or interactions with native modules.  The error message itself might not pinpoint the exact cause, making debugging challenging.  It often involves issues related to file permissions, incorrect paths or references within the project configuration, or conflicts with other tools or libraries used alongside Expo.  Reproducing the error is often inconsistent, which further hinders troubleshooting.
